# ASE220-Assignment05

This project includes a pet shelter frontend and a backend that replicates the JSONBlob.com API using Node.js and Express. To run the backend, navigate to the `jsonblob-backend` folder, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then start the server with `node server.js`. Make sure the `blobs` directory exists and contains a file named `e1ae3136-ca88-462d-8354-52e80ef3dcc8.json` with initial content like `{ "pets": [] }`. To run the frontend, simply open the `Pet-Shelter-Management assignment 2.html` file in your browser. The frontend uses the backend API to fetch, create, and delete pet records by sending GET and PUT requests to `http://localhost:3000/api/jsonBlob/e1ae3136-ca88-462d-8354-52e80ef3dcc8`. An `api.rest` file is included to test the backend endpoints in VS Code using the REST Client extension.


I worked by myself so I did all the work.
